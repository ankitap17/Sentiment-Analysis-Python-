# Sentiment-Analysis-Python-
By using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) algorithm, I created a rule based model for sentiment analysis. 
This code is wirtten in python and it will run successfully in Anaconda environment. 

In this project is focused on top 27 Fashion/ Apparel brands. I collected all tweets where people were talking about this brands or people tagged this brand. Since our focus is to do sentiment analysis I wanted to see how people are reacting to this brands and sentiment associated with the tweets of fashion industries. Below is the dictionary format of tweet. Where we have multiple key value pairs.
The attributes I selected for our analysis purpose includes: Tweet id, username, brand, Time stamp, no. of retweets, favorited count, tweet text (our goal), place and time zone. 
For analysis purpose, I restricted our data size to 60k and collected 2000 tweets of every brands which led to data set of around 60k points. This large dataset was sufficient enough for sentiment analysis.   

The code is uploaded along with output file. 
Since, unsupervied algorithm is implemeted there is no train set.

welcome for any suggestions, 

Best,
